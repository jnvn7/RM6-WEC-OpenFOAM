<div align="justify">
Reference Model 6 (RM6) is a Backward Bent Duct Buoy (BBDB), a type of oscillating water column wave energy converter. The BBDB consists of an air chamber, an L-shaped duct, bow and stern buoyancy modules, and a power take-off (PTO) system composed of a Wells air turbine and a generator, as shown in Figure 1. This L-shaped device opens to the ocean downstream from the wave propagation direction. Power is generated by the motion of the wave, which causes variations in the ambient pressure within the air chamber, forcing air to flow through the Wells turbine. Figure 1 illustrates the main components and dimensions of a BBDB.
