### Placeholder for OpenFOAM Mesh Files
---

- Use `template_mesh_generation` with the provided `flowParams` and CAD file `ducky.stl` to generate the grid for this case.
- Alternatively, the grid can be generated using the examples provided in `examples_mesh_generation/3D_ducky_drop`.
- After generating the `polyMesh` (located in `<mesh>/caseMesh/finalMesh/constant/polyMesh`), 
  rename it to `polyMesh.orig` to replace the placeholder directory.
